Status: 🆕 Ready to deploy

```bash
# Deploy to Render:
1. Go to render.com
2. Connect GitHub repository
3. Use render.yaml blueprint file
4. Add DATABASE_URL environment variable
```

## Option 3: Vercel (Serverless)
Status: 🔄 Could be configured for serverless deployment

## Frontend Deployment
✅ Frontend builds successfully
✅ Production environment configured  
✅ Ready for Vercel deployment

## Database
✅ Supabase PostgreSQL configured
✅ Prisma migrations ready
✅ Connection tested and working

## Next Steps
1. Continue debugging Railway health checks
2. Deploy frontend to Vercel
3. If Railway continues failing, switch to Render
4. Configure CORS for production domains

## Environment Variables Needed
```
DATABASE_URL=your-supabase-connection-string
NODE_ENV=production
